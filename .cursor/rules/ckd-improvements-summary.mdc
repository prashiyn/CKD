- **Added**: Detailed factor analysis requirements with evidence-based explanations
- **Structured**: Clear assessment process with defined risk categories

### 3. Comprehensive Diagnostic Agent
- **Enhanced**: Structured analysis approach for questionnaire responses and diagnostic images
- **Added**: Clinical correlation and pattern recognition capabilities
- **Improved**: Clear formatting requirements for diagnostic assessments

### 4. Professional Presentation Agent
- **Restructured**: Six-section report format for patient-friendly presentation
- **Added**: Executive summary, detailed factor analysis, and actionable recommendations
- **Enhanced**: Clear communication guidelines with empathetic tone

### 5. Better Agent Workflow
- **Fixed**: QnA agent now processes collected data instead of trying to ask questions
- **Improved**: Task descriptions are more specific and actionable
- **Enhanced**: Better dependency management between agents

### 6. Enhanced Medical Knowledge Search
- **Added**: Better error handling and logging
- **Improved**: Source attribution and formatted results
- **Enhanced**: More comprehensive search with 5 results instead of 3

### 7. Comprehensive Error Handling
- **Added**: Try/catch blocks around crew execution
- **Enhanced**: Detailed logging throughout the application
- **Improved**: User-friendly error messages in the UI

## Critical Features Now Implemented

### Factor Analysis Requirements
Each risk factor must include:
1. **Presence Assessment**: Based solely on patient responses
2. **Risk Percentage**: Individual contribution (with specific ranges provided)
3. **Detailed Explanation**: Why this factor increases CKD risk
4. **Evidence Source**: Reference to medical guidelines or historical data
5. **Actionable Recommendations**: Specific steps for the patient

### Risk Categories with Specific Percentages
- **High-Impact Medical Conditions**: 25-50% contribution each
- **Progressive Symptoms**: 5-30% contribution each  
- **Systemic Symptoms**: 2-15% contribution each

### Comprehensive Report Structure
1. Executive Summary with risk levels (Low <25%, Moderate 25-60%, High >60%)
2. Detailed factor analysis with individual contributions
3. Top 3 priority concerns with immediate actions
4. Lifestyle recommendations by category
5. Medical follow-up guidance
6. Positive outlook and resources

## Technical Improvements
- **Complete logging system** for debugging and monitoring
- **Better session state management** for question flow
- **Enhanced vector database integration** with source attribution
- **Robust error handling** throughout the application
- **Standardized agent prompts** with consistent requirements

## Data Integration
- **Historical patient data** properly referenced in research agent
- **KDIGO guidelines** integrated through enhanced vector search
- **Evidence-based assessments** with proper medical references
- **Pattern recognition** using historical CKD development data

These improvements ensure the application now provides comprehensive, evidence-based CKD risk assessments with detailed factor analysis and actionable patient recommendations.
