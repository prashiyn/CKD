# Comprehensive Assessment Reporting

## Overview
The CKD assessment system provides comprehensive reports that include both a complete summary of all questions asked and detailed risk factor analysis.

## Report Structure in [propmpts.py](mdc:propmpts.py)

### 1. Executive Summary
- Overall CKD risk percentage and category
- Risk level classification (Low <25%, Moderate 25-60%, High >60%)
- Confidence level in assessment

### 2. Assessment Summary Table
**Purpose**: Show ALL questions asked and patient responses for transparency and completeness.

**Required Format**:
```markdown
| Question | Patient Response | Factor Status | Clinical Significance |
|----------|------------------|---------------|----------------------|
```

**Requirements**:
- Include EVERY question from the questionnaire, not just positive findings
- Show the patient's exact response
- Categorize each response as Present/Maybe/Not Present
- Explain clinical significance for transparency

### 3. Risk Factors Summary Table
**Purpose**: Focus on identified risk factors and their contributions.

**Required Format**:
```markdown
| Risk Factor | Status | Risk Contribution (%) | Impact Level | Key Recommendations |
|-------------|--------|----------------------|--------------|---------------------|
```

## Implementation in [main.py](mdc:main.py)

### Table Processing Enhancement
The `process_markdown_tables()` function handles multiple tables:

```python
table_count = 0
for i, part in enumerate(parts):
    if part.strip().startswith('|') and '\n|' in part:
        table_count += 1
        if table_count == 1:
            processed_content += f"\n\n**ðŸ“‹ Assessment Summary:**\n\n"
        elif table_count == 2:
            processed_content += f"\n\n**ðŸ“Š Risk Factors Summary:**\n\n"
        else:
            processed_content += f"\n\n**ðŸ“ˆ Additional Data:**\n\n"
        processed_content += part.strip() + "\n\n"
```

### Table Identification
- **First table**: Assessment Summary (all questions and responses)
- **Second table**: Risk Factors Summary (identified risk factors only)
- **Additional tables**: Generic data tables

## Presentation Agent Requirements

### Assessment Summary Specifications
1. **Complete Coverage**: Every question from [propmpts.py](mdc:propmpts.py) questions_list
2. **Exact Responses**: Patient's actual answers, not interpretations
3. **Clinical Interpretation**: Present/Maybe/Not Present categorization
4. **Educational Value**: Brief explanation of why each factor matters

### Factor Status Classifications
- **Present**: Clear indication of risk factor based on patient response
- **Maybe**: Uncertain or intermittent presence of factor
- **Not Present**: Factor clearly absent based on patient response

### Clinical Significance Guidelines
- Explain why each factor matters for CKD risk assessment
- Keep explanations brief but informative
- Use patient-friendly language
- Connect to overall risk picture

## Benefits of Comprehensive Reporting

### For Patients
- **Transparency**: See exactly what was assessed
- **Understanding**: Learn why certain factors matter
- **Validation**: Confirm their responses were understood correctly
- **Education**: Understand the assessment process

### For Healthcare Providers
- **Complete Picture**: Full assessment documentation
- **Decision Support**: Understand basis for risk calculation
- **Follow-up Planning**: See all factors considered
- **Quality Assurance**: Verify assessment completeness

### For System Validation
- **Audit Trail**: Complete record of assessment process
- **Quality Control**: Ensure no questions are missed
- **Accuracy Verification**: Compare responses to risk factors
- **Process Improvement**: Identify assessment gaps

## Table Formatting Best Practices

### Markdown Table Requirements
```markdown
| Column1 | Column2 | Column3 | Column4 |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Data1   | Data2   | Data3   | Data4   |
```

### Content Guidelines
- **Concise Entries**: Keep table cells brief but informative
- **Consistent Format**: Use same format for similar data types
- **Clear Headers**: Self-explanatory column names
- **Patient-Friendly**: Avoid medical jargon where possible

### Visual Enhancement
The `process_markdown_tables()` function adds visual indicators:
- ðŸ“‹ Assessment Summary (comprehensive question review)
- ðŸ“Š Risk Factors Summary (focused risk analysis)
- ðŸ“ˆ Additional Data (supplementary tables)

## Validation Checklist

### Assessment Summary Table
- [ ] Includes ALL questions from questionnaire
- [ ] Shows patient's exact responses
- [ ] Categorizes each as Present/Maybe/Not Present
- [ ] Provides clinical significance for each

### Risk Factors Summary Table
- [ ] Shows only identified risk factors
- [ ] Includes risk contribution percentages
- [ ] Categorizes impact levels
- [ ] Provides specific recommendations

### Overall Report
- [ ] Both tables present and properly formatted
- [ ] Content matches between tables where applicable
- [ ] All sections follow numbered structure
- [ ] Patient-friendly language throughout

This comprehensive approach ensures complete transparency and educational value while maintaining clinical accuracy and usefulness for both patients and healthcare providers.
