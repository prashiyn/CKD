# Tabular Reporting for CKD Risk Assessment

## Overview
The CKD assessment system now generates structured tabular reports alongside narrative text to improve clarity and readability of risk factors and their contributions.

## Implementation in [propmpts.py](mdc:propmpts.py)

### Presentation Agent Requirements
The presentation agent now MUST include a "Risk Factors Summary Table" with these exact columns:

```markdown
| Risk Factor | Status | Risk Contribution (%) | Impact Level | Key Recommendations |
|-------------|--------|---------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| High Blood Pressure | Present | 25% | High | Monitor daily, reduce sodium |
| Kidney Disease History | Present | 30% | High | Regular follow-ups, medication compliance |
| Decreased Appetite | Present | 8% | Low | Nutritional counseling, small frequent meals |
```

### Required Table Structure
- **Risk Factor**: Patient-friendly names (not medical jargon)
- **Status**: Present/Possibly Present/Not Present (based solely on patient responses)
- **Risk Contribution (%)**: Individual percentage (e.g., "25%", "15%", "5%")
- **Impact Level**: High (>20%) / Moderate (10-20%) / Low (<10%)
- **Key Recommendations**: 1-2 specific, actionable steps

## Implementation in [main.py](mdc:main.py)

### Table Processing Function
```python
def process_markdown_tables(content):
    """Process markdown content to enhance table display in Streamlit"""
    import re
    
    # Find all markdown tables in the content
    table_pattern = r'(\|[^\n]+\|(?:\n\|[^\n]+\|)*)'
    tables = re.findall(table_pattern, content)
    
    if tables:
        # Add visual enhancement for tables
        processed_content = ""
        for part in re.split(table_pattern, content):
            if part.strip().startswith('|') and '\n|' in part:
                processed_content += f"\n\n**ðŸ“Š Risk Factors Summary:**\n\n"
                processed_content += part.strip() + "\n\n"
            else:
                processed_content += part
        return processed_content
    
    return content
```

### Usage in Result Display
```python
# Process and display result with enhanced table formatting
processed_result = process_markdown_tables(result)

with st.chat_message("assistant"):
    st.markdown(processed_result)
```

## Agent Prompt Requirements

### Research Agent Output Format
Must provide structured data for each risk factor:
- Clear factor identification
- Specific percentage contributions
- Evidence-based reasoning
- Status determination based on patient responses

### Presentation Agent Table Format
- **MUST include markdown table** in section 2
- Use proper markdown table syntax with headers and separators
- Ensure all identified factors appear as table rows
- Keep table entries concise but informative
- Use consistent percentage format

## Table Content Guidelines

### Risk Factor Naming
- Use patient-friendly terms
- Avoid medical jargon
- Be specific but clear
- Examples: "High Blood Pressure" not "Hypertension"

### Status Classification
- **Present**: Patient clearly indicated factor exists
- **Possibly Present**: Patient indicated "maybe" or unclear response
- **Not Present**: Patient clearly indicated factor does not exist

### Risk Contribution Guidelines
- Base percentages on medical evidence and historical data
- High-impact conditions (diabetes, hypertension): 20-50%
- Progressive symptoms (hematuria, edema): 10-30%
- Systemic symptoms (fatigue, nausea): 5-15%
- Early indicators: 2-10%

### Impact Level Classification
```python
if percentage > 20:
    impact_level = "High"
elif percentage >= 10:
    impact_level = "Moderate"
else:
    impact_level = "Low"
```

## Quality Assurance

### Table Validation
- Verify all identified risk factors appear in table
- Ensure percentages are consistent between table and detailed analysis
- Check that status matches patient responses
- Validate recommendations are actionable

### Display Enhancement
- Tables get visual highlighting with ðŸ“Š icon
- Proper markdown rendering in Streamlit
- Consistent formatting across all reports
- Mobile-friendly table display

## Benefits

### For Patients
- **Quick Overview**: Table provides at-a-glance summary
- **Clear Priorities**: Impact levels help focus attention
- **Actionable Steps**: Key recommendations column provides immediate guidance
- **Easy Comparison**: Side-by-side factor comparison

### For Healthcare Providers
- **Structured Data**: Consistent format for review
- **Evidence-Based**: Clear percentage contributions
- **Comprehensive**: All factors in single view
- **Actionable**: Specific recommendations for follow-up

This tabular approach enhances the readability and usability of CKD risk assessments while maintaining comprehensive narrative explanations.
