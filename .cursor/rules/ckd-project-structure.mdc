# CKD Project Structure and Architecture

## Project Overview
This is a multi-agent chronic kidney disease (CKD) prediction system that combines RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) with CrewAI agents to assess patient risk and provide recommendations.

## Key Files
- [main.py](mdc:main.py) - Main Streamlit application with UI and agent orchestration
- [propmpts.py](mdc:propmpts.py) - Contains all agent prompts and question lists
- [models.py](mdc:models.py) - Data models for patient information
- `.env` - Environment variables for API keys (OPENAI_API_KEY, GROQ_API_KEY)

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Streamlit for web interface
- **Multi-Agent Framework**: CrewAI for agent orchestration
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o and Groq models (Llama, DeepSeek, Mistral)
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB with OpenAI embeddings
- **Document Processing**: LangChain for PDF loading and text splitting
- **RAG Implementation**: LangChain + ChromaDB for knowledge retrieval

## Agent Architecture
The system uses 5 specialized agents in sequential processing:

1. **QnA Agent** - Collects patient information through structured questionnaire
2. **Diagnostic Agent** - Analyzes patient responses and diagnostic images
3. **Research Agent** - Assesses CKD risk using historical patient data and medical knowledge
4. **Critique Agent** - Reviews and validates the risk assessment
5. **Presentation Agent** - Formats final results for user-friendly presentation

## Data Flow
1. Patient answers 22 medical questions via Streamlit interface
2. Answers collected in JSON format and stored in session state
3. Sequential agent processing with dependency management
4. Final presentation of CKD risk assessment and recommendations

## Key Patterns
- Session state management for question tracking and answer collection
- CrewAI task dependencies using sequential processing
- RAG integration for medical knowledge search
- Image upload support for diagnostic analysis
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
