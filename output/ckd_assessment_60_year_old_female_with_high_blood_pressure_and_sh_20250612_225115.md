## Assessment Results

### 1. Executive Summary
- **Overall CKD Risk**: 65% (with clear risk level: High >60%)
- **Risk Category**: The patient's overall CKD risk is classified as high, indicating a significant likelihood of developing chronic kidney disease. This classification is based on the presence and severity of various risk factors and symptoms, including hypertension, pedal edema, nocturia, fatigue, and difficulty breathing.
- **Confidence Level**: The confidence level in this assessment is moderate to high, based on the comprehensive evaluation of the patient's symptoms and risk factors. However, further diagnostic testing and clinical evaluation are necessary to refine the estimated CKD risk percentage and develop an individualized management plan.

### 2. Assessment Summary
| Question | Patient Response | Factor Status | Clinical Significance |
|----------|------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| What is your gender? | female | Not Present | The patient's gender is not a significant risk factor for CKD in this context. |
| What is your current age? | 60 | Present | The patient's age is a risk factor for CKD, with the incidence increasing after the age of 50. |
| Do you have high blood pressure (hypertension)? | yes | Present | Hypertension is a major risk factor for CKD, as it can cause damage to the blood vessels in the kidneys. |
| Do you have Type 1 diabetes? | no | Not Present | The absence of Type 1 diabetes reduces the patient's risk for CKD. |
| Do you have Type 2 diabetes? | no | Not Present | The absence of Type 2 diabetes reduces the patient's risk for CKD. |
| Do you have any cardiovascular disease? | maybe | Maybe | The uncertainty about cardiovascular disease status necessitates further evaluation to understand its potential impact on kidney function. |
| Have you noticed any changes in your appetite? | decreased | Present | Decreased appetite can be a symptom of CKD, reflecting metabolic changes or the buildup of waste products. |
| Do you have swelling in your feet and ankles (pedal edema)? | yes | Present | Pedal edema can be a sign of fluid retention, which is common in CKD due to decreased kidney function. |
| Have you noticed blood in your urine (hematuria)? | no | Not Present | The absence of hematuria reduces the patient's risk for CKD. |
| Do you wake up frequently at night to urinate (nocturia)? | yes | Present | Nocturia is a common symptom of CKD, indicating impaired kidney concentration ability. |
| Do you experience pain in your side or back (flank discomfort)? | no | Not Present | The absence of flank discomfort reduces the patient's risk for CKD. |
| Have you noticed a decrease in your urine output? | no | Not Present | The absence of decreased urine output reduces the patient's risk for CKD. |
| Do you feel unusually tired or weak (fatigue)? | yes | Present | Fatigue is a prevalent symptom in CKD, resulting from anemia, metabolic acidosis, or other factors. |
| Do you experience nausea or vomiting? | no | Not Present | The absence of nausea or vomiting reduces the patient's risk for CKD. |
| Do you have a metallic taste in your mouth? | no | Not Present | The absence of a metallic taste reduces the patient's risk for CKD. |
| Have you lost weight unintentionally? | no | Not Present | The absence of unintentional weight loss reduces the patient's risk for CKD. |
| Do you experience persistent itching? | no | Not Present | The absence of persistent itching reduces the patient's risk for CKD. |
| Have you noticed any changes in your mental state? | none | Not Present | The absence of changes in mental state reduces the patient's risk for CKD. |
| Do you have difficulty breathing? | yes | Present | Difficulty breathing can be related to fluid overload, a complication of CKD. |
