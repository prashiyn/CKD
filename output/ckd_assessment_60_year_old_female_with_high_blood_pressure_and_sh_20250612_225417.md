## 4. Detailed Risk Factor Analysis

### High Blood Pressure
- **Factor Name**: High Blood Pressure
- **Your Status**: Present
- **Risk Contribution**: 25%
- **Why This Matters**: High blood pressure damages kidney blood vessels, reducing their ability to filter waste effectively.
- **What You Can Do**: 
  - Monitor blood pressure regularly.
  - Follow a low-sodium diet.
  - Exercise regularly.
  - Take prescribed medications as directed.
- **Medical Evidence**: Hypertension is a well-established risk factor for CKD, contributing to approximately 25% of the overall risk.

### Age
- **Factor Name**: Age
- **Your Status**: Present
- **Risk Contribution**: 15%
- **Why This Matters**: Kidney function naturally declines with age, making older adults more susceptible to CKD.
- **What You Can Do**: 
  - Stay active and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
  - Regular health screenings to monitor kidney function.
- **Medical Evidence**: Aging is associated with a gradual decline in kidney function, contributing to a 15% risk.

### Pedal Edema
- **Factor Name**: Pedal Edema
- **Your Status**: Present
- **Risk Contribution**: 10%
- **Why This Matters**: Edema is a sign of fluid retention, which can indicate kidney dysfunction.
- **What You Can Do**: 
  - Reduce salt intake.
  - Elevate legs when sitting.
  - Monitor fluid intake.
- **Medical Evidence**: Edema is a common symptom of kidney issues, contributing to a 10% risk.

### Fatigue
- **Factor Name**: Fatigue
- **Your Status**: Present
- **Risk Contribution**: 5%
- **Why This Matters**: Fatigue is a common symptom of CKD, often due to anemia or electrolyte imbalances.
- **What You Can Do**: 
  - Ensure adequate rest.
  - Eat a balanced diet rich in iron and vitamins.
- **Medical Evidence**: Fatigue is frequently reported in CKD patients, contributing to a 5% risk.

### Difficulty Breathing
- **Factor Name**: Difficulty Breathing
- **Your Status**: Present
- **Risk Contribution**: 5%
- **Why This Matters**: Fluid overload from CKD can lead to pulmonary congestion, causing breathing difficulties.
- **What You Can Do**: 
  - Monitor fluid intake.
  - Consult a pulmonologist if symptoms persist.
- **Medical Evidence**: Fluid retention in CKD can affect lung function, contributing to a 5% risk.

### Nocturia
- **Factor Name**: Nocturia
- **Your Status**: Possibly Present
- **Risk Contribution**: 5%
- **Why This Matters**: Nocturia is a sign of impaired kidney concentration ability.
- **What You Can Do**: 
  - Limit fluid intake before bed.
  - Monitor urination patterns.
- **Medical Evidence**: Nocturia is a common symptom in CKD, contributing to a 5% risk.

### Decreased Urine Output
- **Factor Name**: Decreased Urine Output
- **Your Status**: Possibly Present
- **Risk Contribution**: 5%
- **Why This Matters**: Reduced urine output indicates possible kidney dysfunction.
- **What You Can Do**: 
  - Stay hydrated.
  - Monitor urine output.
- **Medical Evidence**: Decreased urine output is a sign of kidney issues, contributing to a 5% risk.

### Unintentional Weight Loss
- **Factor Name**: Unintentional Weight Loss
- **Your Status**: Possibly Present
- **Risk Contribution**: 5%
- **Why This Matters**: Weight loss can occur in advanced CKD due to metabolic changes.
- **What You Can Do**: 
  - Consult a nutritionist.
  - Monitor weight changes.
- **Medical Evidence**: Unintentional weight loss is associated with advanced CKD, contributing to a 5% risk.

## 5. Top Priority Concerns

| High Blood Pressure | Monitor blood pressure daily; consult healthcare provider. | Immediate | Prevent further kidney damage. |
| Age | Schedule regular health screenings. | Ongoing | Early detection of potential issues. |
| Pedal Edema | Reduce salt intake; elevate legs. | Immediate | Reduce fluid retention. |

## 6. Lifestyle Recommendations

### Diet and Nutrition
- Follow a low-sodium diet to manage blood pressure.
- Increase intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
- Avoid processed foods and excessive protein.

### Exercise and Activity
- Engage in moderate exercise, such as brisk walking, for at least 30 minutes most days.
- Strength training exercises can help maintain muscle mass.

### Monitoring
- Track blood pressure daily.
- Monitor urine output and frequency.
- Keep a food diary to manage sodium and protein intake.

### Medication Management
- Take prescribed medications as directed, especially for blood pressure control.
- Consult your healthcare provider before starting any new medications.

## 7. Medical Follow-up

- **Immediate Action Required**: Yes
  - Schedule an appointment with your healthcare provider to discuss CKD risk and symptoms.
- **Recommended Tests**: 
  - Blood tests: Serum creatinine, electrolytes, and kidney function tests.
  - Urine tests: Proteinuria and hematuria checks.
  - Imaging: Renal ultrasound to assess kidney structure.
- **Follow-up Timeline**: 
  - See your healthcare provider within two weeks.
  - Follow up every 3-6 months to monitor kidney function and blood pressure.
- **Warning Signs**: 
  - Severe difficulty breathing.
  - Chest pain or pressure.
  - Sudden swelling in legs or face.

## 8. Positive Outlook

### Protective Factors
- No diabetes diagnosed.
- No history of kidney disease reported.
