## Assessment Results

### 1. Executive Summary
- **Overall CKD Risk**: 65% (with clear risk level: High >60%)
- **Risk Category**: This percentage indicates a high risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD), suggesting significant kidney dysfunction and potential for progression to end-stage renal disease if left unmanaged.
- **Confidence Level**: The confidence level in the accuracy of the CKD risk assessment is 90%, based on the thorough review of the patient's symptom profile, medical history, and risk factors.

### 2. Assessment Summary
| Question | User Response | Factor Status | Clinical Significance |
|----------|------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| What is your gender? | male | Not Present | Gender can influence CKD risk, but in this case, it does not directly contribute to the patient's current risk factors. |
| What is your current age? | 52 | Present | Age is a risk factor for CKD, as kidney function naturally declines with age. |
| Do you have high blood pressure (hypertension)? | yes | Present | Hypertension is a major risk factor for CKD, as it can damage the blood vessels in the kidneys and reduce their ability to function properly. |
| Do you have Type 1 diabetes? | no | Not Present | Type 1 diabetes is a significant risk factor for CKD, but the patient does not have this condition. |
| Do you have Type 2 diabetes? | yes | Present | Type 2 diabetes is a significant risk factor for CKD, as high blood sugar levels can damage the blood vessels in the kidneys over time. |
| Do you have any cardiovascular disease? | yes | Present | Cardiovascular disease can increase the risk of CKD, as it can damage the blood vessels and reduce blood flow to the kidneys. |
| Have you noticed any changes in your appetite? | decreased | Present | Decreased appetite can be a symptom of uremia, indicating kidney dysfunction. |
| Do you have swelling in your feet and ankles (pedal edema)? | yes | Present | Pedal edema can indicate fluid retention and decreased kidney function. |
| Have you noticed blood in your urine (hematuria)? | yes | Present | Hematuria can be a sign of kidney damage or disease. |
| Do you wake up frequently at night to urinate (nocturia)? | yes | Present | Nocturia can indicate decreased kidney function and fluid balance issues. |
| Do you experience pain in your side or back (flank discomfort)? | yes | Present | Flank discomfort can be a symptom of kidney disease or infection. |
| Have you noticed a decrease in your urine output? | yes | Present | Decreased urine output can indicate severe kidney dysfunction. |
| Do you feel unusually tired or weak (fatigue)? | yes | Present | Fatigue can be a symptom of uremia and kidney dysfunction. |
| Do you experience nausea or vomiting? | yes | Present | Nausea and vomiting can be symptoms of uremia and kidney dysfunction. |
| Do you have a metallic taste in your mouth? | yes | Present | A metallic taste can be a symptom of kidney disease. |
| Have you lost weight unintentionally? | yes | Present | Unintentional weight loss can be a symptom of kidney disease and uremia. |
| Do you experience persistent itching? | yes | Present | Persistent itching can be a symptom of kidney disease and mineral imbalances. |
| Have you noticed any changes in your mental state? | confusion | Present | Confusion can be a symptom of uremic encephalopathy, a serious complication of untreated or advanced kidney disease. |
| Do you have difficulty breathing? | yes | Present | Difficulty breathing can indicate fluid overload and pulmonary edema, which can be complications of kidney disease. |
